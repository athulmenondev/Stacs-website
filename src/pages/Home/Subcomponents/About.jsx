            Students' Association of Computer Science (STACS) is the departmental
            association of both B.Tech and M.Tech students of the Computer Science
            and Engineering Department. This association will be an integration of
            students into academic communities at the department level, crossing
            the course boundary, providing a platform to organise a range of
            activities with the support and resources of the department. The
            association will provide opportunities for students to share a range of
            extra-curricular experiences.
